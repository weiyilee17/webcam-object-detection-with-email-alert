# What is this project?
This app detects objects entering the camera and sends email with attachments.

The current problem of this app is that, the image processing algorithm and the parameters still needs to be fine-tuned. It doesn't correctly capture an entire object (sometimes it detects a hand as multiple objects), and it assumes 1 object enters and leaves at a time.

As a beginner's project, it is enough, but it has a long way to go for practical usage.
